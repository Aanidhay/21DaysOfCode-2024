**Question 1:** 
Given a binary search tree (BST) and two nodes, find their lowest common ancestor (LCA).
##### Inputs:
-	The root node of the BST.
Two nodes for which the LCA is to be found.
##### Output:
-	The value of the LCA node.
##### Example:
# BST:
```
       20
      /  \
    10    30
   /  \  /  \
  5   15 25  35
 ```
#### Nodes: 5, 30
#### Output: 20

**Question 2:** 
Given a binary search tree (BST) and a value, insert the value into the BST while maintaining its properties.
##### Inputs:
-	The root node of the BST.
The value to be inserted.
##### Output:
- The root node of the updated BST.
##### Example:
```
 BST:
       4
      / \
     2   7
    / \
   1   3

## WEB-DEV:
Today, we aim to explore the necessity and function of databases. Given that many of us will be setting up MySQL, we'll focus on foundational questions.
1.	Create a database named ACM21DOC.
2.	Create a table named STUDENTS as followed:
[ Name VARCHAR(15) NOT NULL, Bdate DATE, Sex CHAR]
3.	Input some dummy entry and use SELECT * FROM STUDENTS to display all the entry.
Submit all the queries performed in a .txt file
