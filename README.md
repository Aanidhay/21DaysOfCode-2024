## DSA:
**Question 1:**  Write a function to determine the height of a binary tree. The height is defined as the number of edges between the root and the furthest leaf.
##### Inputs:
-	The root node of the binary tree.
##### Output:
-	The height of the tree.
##### Example:
```
Binary Tree:
      3
     / \
    2   5
   /   / \
  1   4   6
```
##### Output: 2

**Question 2:** Implement a function to perform a level order traversal (breadth-first traversal) on a binary tree.
##### Inputs:
-	The root node of the binary tree.
##### Output:
- The values of the nodes in level order.
##### Example:
```
Binary Tree:
      3
     / \
    9  20
       / \
      15  7
```
##### Output: [3, 9, 20, 15, 7]








## WEB-DEV:

1.	 Create a React component called ButtonClicker that displays a button. When clicked, the button should change its text from "Click me" to "Clicked!".
2.	Create a React component called LikeButton that displays a button labeled "Like". When clicked, it should increment a count displayed next to the button indicating how many times it's been clicked.
3.	Create a React component called TrafficLight that displays a traffic light with three colors: Red, Yellow, and Green. Implement a button that toggles the state of the traffic light (Red -> Green -> Yellow -> Red).
